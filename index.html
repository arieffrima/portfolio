										Currently, I am working on a personal project to create a website for one coffee shop. Utilizing a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I have successfully implemented a shopping cart feature that is ready to connect to a payment gateway. This feature aims to provide users with a comfortable and efficient shopping experience while ensuring smooth payment transactions through integration with a reliable payment gateway. With the presence of this shopping cart, it is hoped that customers can easily browse and select their desired coffee products or merchandise before proceeding to a secure and straightforward payment process.</p>

													BuyOnline is a simplified web-based online shopping system developed to allow customers to register, log in, and make purchases, as well as store managers to manage product listings and process sold items. This project demonstrates the use of HTML, JavaScript, PHP, XML, and AJAX for client-server communication and data management.
												</p>
												
												<p><strong>Files:</strong></p>
												<ul>
													<li>buyonline.htm: Main page with links to customer registration, customer login, and store manager login.</li>
													<li>register.htm: Customer registration form where new customers can register with the system.</li>
													<li>login.htm: Customer login page to authenticate customers and redirect to the buying page.</li>
													<li>mlogin.htm: Store manager login page to authenticate managers and provide access to item listing and processing functions.</li>
													<li>buying.htm: Customer buying page displaying available items and allowing customers to add items to the shopping cart.</li>
													<li>listing.htm: Store manager page to add new items to the store inventory.</li>
													<li>processing.htm: Store manager page to process sold items and update the inventory.</li>
													<li>customer.xml: XML file that stores customer information such as customer ID, first name, surname, email, password, and phone number.</li>
													<li>goods.xml: XML file that stores item information such as item number, name, description, price, quantity available, quantity on hold, and quantity sold.</li>
													<li>manager.txt: A text file storing manager IDs and passwords.</li>
												</ul>
												

												
												<p><strong>Additional Information:</strong></p>
												<ul>
													<li>Uses session variables for tracking logins.</li>
													<li>AJAX updates available items on the buying page.</li>
													<li>Client-side and server-side input validation is implemented.</li>
												</ul>
												
												<p>Notes: The system does not include payment processing or advanced password management, which may be added in future versions.</p>

									<p>My Object-Oriented Programming project using Java and a Graphical User Interface (GUI), titled "GUI Parking Spot System." This project aims to enhance the original console-based interface by transitioning it into an intuitive and user-friendly GUI.

										I researched extensively to design a GUI that effectively represents parking spots, indicates when a spot is occupied by a car, and incorporates user-friendly components for input and selection. The system also displays all necessary messages within the GUI, ensuring clarity and ease of use.
									   
									   Key components of this project include:
									   
									   GUI Components: The interface is designed using various GUI components such as buttons, text fields, and labels to allow user interaction and input.
									   Event Handling: I employed appropriate ActionListeners to capture user events and respond accordingly, ensuring the system's operations function as required.
									   Layout Management: The use of Layout Managers helped in organizing the GUI components in a way that is both functional and visually appealing.
									   
									   Importantly, this project is built from scratch without using any GUI development IDE or framework tools, demonstrating my proficiency in creating a fully functional GUI through pure coding techniques.
									   
									   In summary, this project showcases my ability to:
									   
									   Capture and respond to user events using ActionListeners.
									   Design an easy-to-use GUI that effectively represents the system's functionality.
									   Organize GUI components using Layout Managers and other essential elements.</p>

										<h2>Multi-Cloud Architecture Deployment<br />
										(AWS and Oracle)</h2>
									</header>
									<a href= class="image fit"><img src="images/pic10.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In this comprehensive hybrid cloud architecture, I meticulously designed and implemented a robust integration between Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and Amazon Web Services (AWS), showcasing my expertise in multi-cloud solutions. This architecture leverages a secure IPSec VPN tunnel to seamlessly connect a Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) in OCI with a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in AWS, ensuring secure, reliable, and efficient data transfer across cloud environments. The OCI segment includes public and private subnets that host critical components such as Bastion hosts, PHPAdmin, and a MySQL database, with stringent access controls managed through Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Security Lists. Meanwhile, the AWS segment incorporates a similar structure, with public and private subnets containing Bastion/Web servers and test instances, protected by Security Groups and Network ACLs (NACLs). This design not only enhances data security but also optimizes resource allocation, providing high availability and scalability. Key functionalities include the storage and synchronization of user-uploaded photos, with metadata shared seamlessly between OCI and AWS for further processing. This project underscores my ability to integrate complex cloud environments, ensuring robust security, efficient resource management, and seamless user experience.</p>
