										Currently, I am working on a personal project to create a website for one coffee shop in Indonesia. Utilizing a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I have successfully implemented a shopping cart feature that is ready to connect to a payment gateway. This feature aims to provide users with a comfortable and efficient shopping experience while ensuring smooth payment transactions through integration with a reliable payment gateway. With the presence of this shopping cart, it is hoped that customers can easily browse and select their desired coffee products or merchandise before proceeding to a secure and straightforward payment process.</p>

										<p>This is a group project details the design and development of an application for
											Bright Boost, which is an after-school program for students. The report highlights important
											features such as user login, attendance monitoring, question logging, and more.
											The report delves into the proposed features and functionalities, key technical decisions, design
											aspects, a timeline, and finally a few risk management strategies for the project. The ultimate
											objective of the project is to make Bright Boost’s tutoring experience more efficient and
											seamless.</p>

												In this project, the aim is to create a user-friendly website for an IT company to advertise and manage job openings. The site, built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, DOM, PHP, and MySQL, follows W3C standards for a solid foundation. Client-side interactivity is improved with JavaScript and DOM manipulation, providing a smooth user experience. PHP on the server side communicates with a MySQL database, effectively managing job listings with detailed position descriptions. The website streamlines the recruitment process by enabling easy online form submissions. Considerations like XML integration and thorough cross-browser testing enhance accessibility and reliability. During deployment, careful web hosting service selection and security measures, such as input validation and best database query practices, are prioritized. Extensive documentation, covering user guides and technical aspects, ensures long-term usability and understanding. The result is a robust, interactive, and secure website benefiting both the IT company and potential candidates in the recruitment process.</p>

									<p>My Object-Oriented Programming project using Java and a Graphical User Interface (GUI), titled "GUI Parking Spot System." This project aims to enhance the original console-based interface by transitioning it into an intuitive and user-friendly GUI.

										I researched extensively to design a GUI that effectively represents parking spots, indicates when a spot is occupied by a car, and incorporates user-friendly components for input and selection. The system also displays all necessary messages within the GUI, ensuring clarity and ease of use.
									   
									   Key components of this project include:
									   
									   GUI Components: The interface is designed using various GUI components such as buttons, text fields, and labels to allow user interaction and input.
									   Event Handling: I employed appropriate ActionListeners to capture user events and respond accordingly, ensuring the system's operations function as required.
									   Layout Management: The use of Layout Managers helped in organizing the GUI components in a way that is both functional and visually appealing.
									   
									   Importantly, this project is built from scratch without using any GUI development IDE or framework tools, demonstrating my proficiency in creating a fully functional GUI through pure coding techniques.
									   
									   In summary, this project showcases my ability to:
									   
									   Capture and respond to user events using ActionListeners.
									   Design an easy-to-use GUI that effectively represents the system's functionality.
									   Organize GUI components using Layout Managers and other essential elements.</p>
